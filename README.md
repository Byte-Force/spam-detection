# Spam Detection

This is a repo for investigating on Spam dectection for the project **Campus Connect**

## Development Progress:

- [ ] Create a model for spam detection (First model as the baseline, will probably be in Jupyter Notebook) 
- [ ] Finding the Best Model for Spam Detection with different Data Sets
- [ ] Fine tune the model with our own data set (Still thinking about ways to generate training dataset)
- [ ] Create a Node.js API for the model
